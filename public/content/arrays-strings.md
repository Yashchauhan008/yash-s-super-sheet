# Arrays & Strings

Arrays and strings are fundamental data structures in computer science.

## Arrays

An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together.

### Key Characteristics:
*   **Fixed Size:** In many languages, arrays have a fixed size once declared.
*   **Homogeneous:** All elements are of the same data type.
*   **Random Access:** Elements can be accessed directly using their index (O(1) time complexity).

## Strings

A string is typically a sequence of characters. In many programming languages, strings are implemented as arrays of characters.

### Common String Operations:
*   Concatenation
*   Substring extraction
*   Searching
*   Reversal
