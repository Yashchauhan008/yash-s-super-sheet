# Blood Relations

These problems test your ability to understand and map family relationships.

## Key Concepts
*   **Relationships**: Paternal (father's side), Maternal (mother's side).
*   **Generations**: Grandparents, Parents, Self, Children, Grandchildren.
*   **Symbols**: Use symbols for clarity (e.g., `+` for male, `-` for female, `=` for married, `|` for parent-child).

## Problem-Solving Techniques
1.  **Family Tree Diagram**: The most effective method. A visual chart helps track complex relationships.
2.  **Break Down the Statement**: Analyze the information piece by piece.
3.  **Work Backwards**: Sometimes, starting from the last person mentioned and working backwards is easier.

## Examples

**1. Direct Description**
*   **Question**: Pointing to a man, a woman said, "His mother is the only daughter of my mother." How is the woman related to the man?
*   **Solution**:
    *   "Only daughter of my mother" means the woman herself.
    *   So, the statement becomes "His mother is me (the woman)".
    *   Therefore, the woman is the man's mother.

**2. Coded Relation**
*   **Question**: If 'A + B' means 'A is the father of B' and 'A × B' means 'A is the sister of B', what does the expression P + R × Q mean?
*   **Solution**:
    *   `P + R`: P is the father of R.
    *   `R × Q`: R is the sister of Q.
    *   Combining these: P is the father of both R (a female) and Q.
    *   This means P is the father of Q.
