# Coding-Decoding

This section tests the ability to decipher a code or pattern from a given message or set of messages.

## Key Concepts & Types
*   **Letter Coding**: Letters are replaced by other letters based on a specific rule (e.g., shifting positions, reversing order).
*   **Number/Symbol Coding**: Letters are assigned numeric codes or symbols.
*   **Substitution Coding**: Each letter or word is substituted with another.
*   **Mixed Coding**: A mix of the above types.

## Problem-Solving Techniques
*   **Analyze the Pattern**: Look for patterns like forward/backward letter shifts, opposite letters (A-Z, B-Y), or jumbled letters.
*   **Position of Letters**: Memorize the position of letters in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26) and in reverse (A=26, B=25, ..., Z=1). The word **EJOTY** (5, 10, 15, 20, 25) can be a helpful mnemonic.
*   **Common Patterns**: Check for vowels/consonants logic, addition/subtraction of position numbers, or direct coding from a given key.
*   **Make a Table**: For substitution coding, create a table to map the original letters to their coded counterparts.
