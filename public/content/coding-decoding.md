# Coding-Decoding

This tests the ability to decipher a code or pattern from a given message.

## Key Concepts & Types
*   **Letter Coding**: Letters are shifted, reversed, or replaced based on a rule.
*   **Number/Symbol Coding**: Letters are assigned numbers or symbols.
*   **Substitution Coding**: Words or letters are substituted with others.

## Problem-Solving Techniques
*   **Analyze the Pattern**: Look for forward/backward shifts, opposite letters (A-Z, B-Y), or jumbled letters.
*   **Letter Positions**: Memorize letter positions (A=1, Z=26). The mnemonic **EJOTY** (5, 10, 15, 20, 25) is helpful.
*   **Compare Common Letters**: In substitution coding, look for common letters in different words to find their codes.

## Examples

**1. Letter Shift**
*   **Question**: If 'TEACHER' is coded as 'VGCJGT', how is 'CHILDREN' coded?
*   **Solution**:
    *   Observe the pattern: T (+2) -> V, E (+2) -> G, A (+2) -> C, and so on. Each letter is shifted two positions forward.
    *   Applying the same pattern to 'CHILDREN':
    *   C (+2) -> E, H (+2) -> J, I (+2) -> K, L (+2) -> N, D (+2) -> F, R (+2) -> T, E (+2) -> G, N (+2) -> P.
    *   The code is 'EJKNFTGP'.

**2. Substitution**
*   **Question**: In a certain code, 'go home' is written as 'ta na' and 'sweet home' is written as 'ja na'. How is 'sweet' written in that code?
*   **Solution**:
    *   In both phrases, the common word is 'home' and the common code is 'na'.
    *   Therefore, 'home' = 'na'.
    *   In the second phrase, 'sweet home' is 'ja na'. Since 'home' is 'na', 'sweet' must be 'ja'.
