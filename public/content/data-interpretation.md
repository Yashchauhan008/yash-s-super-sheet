# Data Interpretation

This involves understanding and interpreting data presented in various formats like tables, graphs, and charts.

## Key Concepts & Types
*   **Tables**: Data is organized in rows and columns.
*   **Bar Graphs**: Compare data across different categories.
*   **Line Graphs**: Show trends over a period of time.
*   **Pie Charts**: Represent data as proportions or percentages of a whole.
*   **Caselets**: Data is presented in the form of a paragraph.

## Problem-Solving Techniques
1.  **Read Carefully**: First, understand the title, labels, units, and scale of the chart or table.
2.  **Focus on the Question**: Read the question carefully to understand what specific information you need to find.
3.  **Approximate**: Don't always calculate the exact values. If the options are far apart, approximation can save a lot of time.
4.  **Master Percentages and Ratios**: Most DI questions involve calculations of percentages, ratios, averages, and growth rates.
5.  **For Pie Charts**: Remember that the total angle is 360Â° and the total percentage is 100%. You can convert between them.
