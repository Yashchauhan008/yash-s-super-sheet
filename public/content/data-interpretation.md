# Data Interpretation

This involves understanding and interpreting data presented in tables, graphs, and charts.

## Key Concepts & Types
*   **Tables**: Data in rows and columns.
*   **Bar Graphs**: Compare data across categories.
*   **Line Graphs**: Show trends over time.
*   **Pie Charts**: Represent proportions of a whole.

## Problem-Solving Techniques
1.  **Read the Data Carefully**: Understand the title, labels, units, and scale.
2.  **Approximate**: If options are far apart, estimate instead of calculating precisely.
3.  **Master Percentages and Ratios**: Most DI questions involve these calculations.
4.  **For Pie Charts**: Total angle = 360
