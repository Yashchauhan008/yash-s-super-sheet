# Direction Sense

These questions test your ability to track directions and distances.

## Key Concepts
*   **Cardinal Directions**: North (N), South (S), East (E), West (W).
*   **Ordinal Directions**: North-East (NE), North-West (NW), South-East (SE), South-West (SW).
*   **Turns**:
    *   Right turn from North is East.
    *   Left turn from North is West.
    *   A clockwise turn is a right turn.
    *   An anti-clockwise turn is a left turn.
*   **Pythagoras Theorem**: Used to find the shortest distance between the starting and ending points. `(Hypotenuse)² = (Base)² + (Perpendicular)²`.

## Problem-Solving Techniques
1.  **Draw a Diagram**: Always draw a simple diagram representing the path taken. Start from a point and use arrows to indicate direction and lines to represent distance.
2.  **Assume You Are Facing North**: Unless specified otherwise, assume the person starts by facing North.
3.  **Shadow Problems**:
    *   In the morning (sunrise in the East), the shadow is in the West.
    *   In the evening (sunset in the West), the shadow is in the East.
