# Encapsulation

Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts. It refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class.

## Key Principles:
1.  **Data Hiding:** The internal state of an object is hidden from the outside world. Data is accessed only through public methods.
2.  **Information Hiding:** Users of the class don't need to know how the class works internally, only how to interact with its public interface.

## Benefits:
*   **Security:** Prevents direct access to sensitive data.
*   **Maintainability:** Changes to internal implementation don't affect external code.
*   **Flexibility:** Allows for easier modification and extension.
