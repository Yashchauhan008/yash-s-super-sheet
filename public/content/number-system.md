# Number System

The number system deals with different types of numbers, their properties, and relationships. It's the bedrock of quantitative aptitude.

## Key Concepts
*   **Types of Numbers**: Natural, Whole, Integers, Rational, Irrational, Prime, Composite.
*   **Divisibility Rules**: Shortcuts to check if a number is divisible by another.
*   **HCF and LCM**: Highest Common Factor and Lowest Common Multiple.
*   **Units Digit**: Finding the last digit of a number raised to a large power.
*   **Remainders**: Finding the remainder when one number is divided by another.

## Formula Shortcuts
*   **Sum of first 'n' natural numbers**: `n(n+1)/2`
*   **Product of two numbers**: `HCF * LCM` of the two numbers.
*   **Divisibility Rule for 11**: The difference between the sum of digits at odd places and the sum of digits at even places is 0 or a multiple of 11.

## Examples

**1. Divisibility Rule**
*   **Question**: Is the number 729342 divisible by 11?
*   **Solution**:
    *   Sum of digits at odd places (1st, 3rd, 5th): 7 + 9 + 4 = 20
    *   Sum of digits at even places (2nd, 4th, 6th): 2 + 3 + 2 = 7
    *   Difference: 20 - 7 = 13
    *   Since 13 is not 0 or a multiple of 11, the number is not divisible by 11.

**2. HCF and LCM**
*   **Question**: The HCF of two numbers is 11 and their LCM is 693. If one of the numbers is 77, find the other.
*   **Solution**:
    *   Formula: `Product of two numbers = HCF Ã— LCM`
    *   Let the other number be 'x'.
    *   `77 * x = 11 * 693`
    *   `x = (11 * 693) / 77`
    *   `x = 693 / 7 = 99`
    *   The other number is 99.
