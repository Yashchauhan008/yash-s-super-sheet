# Number System

The number system is the foundation of quantitative aptitude, dealing with different types of numbers, their properties, and relationships.

## Key Concepts

*   **Types of Numbers**: Natural Numbers, Whole Numbers, Integers, Rational Numbers, Irrational Numbers, Real Numbers, Prime Numbers, Composite Numbers.
*   **Divisibility Rules**: Rules to quickly determine if a number is divisible by another number (e.g., by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11).
*   **HCF and LCM**: Highest Common Factor and Lowest Common Multiple are crucial for solving a variety of problems.
*   **Units Digit**: Finding the last digit of a large exponential expression.
*   **Remainders**: Concepts related to the remainder theorem.

## Formula Shortcuts

*   **Sum of first 'n' natural numbers**: `n(n+1)/2`
*   **Sum of first 'n' odd numbers**: `n^2`
*   **Sum of first 'n' even numbers**: `n(n+1)`
*   **Sum of squares of first 'n' natural numbers**: `n(n+1)(2n+1)/6`
*   **Sum of cubes of first 'n' natural numbers**: `[n(n+1)/2]^2`
*   **Product of two numbers**: `HCF * LCM` of the two numbers.
*   **Divisibility Rule for 11**: The difference between the sum of digits at odd places and the sum of digits at even places is either 0 or divisible by 11.
