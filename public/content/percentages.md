# Percentages

Percentages represent a fraction of 100 and are a core concept for profit & loss, interest, and data interpretation.

## Key Concepts
*   **Percentage Calculation**: `(Part / Whole) * 100`
*   **Fraction-Percentage Conversion**: Essential for quick calculations (e.g., 1/4 = 25%, 1/5 = 20%).
*   **Percentage Change**: `((New Value - Original Value) / Original Value) * 100`

## Formula Shortcuts
*   **If A is x% more than B, then B is less than A by**: `(x / (100 + x)) * 100 %`
*   **If A is x% less than B, then B is more than A by**: `(x / (100 - x)) * 100 %`
*   **Successive Percentage Change (x% and y%)**: Net effect = `(x + y + (xy/100))%` (Use negative signs for decrease).

## Examples

**1. Percentage Change**
*   **Question**: A student's score increased from 60 to 75. What is the percentage increase?
*   **Solution**:
    *   Increase in score = 75 - 60 = 15
    *   Percentage Increase = `(Increase / Original Score) * 100`
    *   `= (15 / 60) * 100 = (1/4) * 100 = 25%`

**2. Successive Percentage Change**
*   **Question**: The price of an item is first increased by 20% and then decreased by 10%. What is the net percentage change?
*   **Solution**:
    *   Let x = +20 (increase) and y = -10 (decrease).
    *   Net Change = `(20 - 10 + (20 * -10) / 100)%`
    *   `= (10 - 200 / 100)% = (10 - 2)% = 8%`
    *   There is a net increase of 8%.
