# Percentages

Percentages are a fundamental concept used to express a number as a fraction of 100. They are widely applied in various areas like profit & loss, interest calculations, and data interpretation.

## Key Concepts

*   **Percentage Calculation**: `(Value / Total Value) * 100`
*   **Fraction to Percentage Conversion**: Multiply the fraction by 100.
*   **Percentage to Fraction Conversion**: Divide the percentage by 100.
*   **Percentage Increase/Decrease**: `((New Value - Original Value) / Original Value) * 100`

## Formula Shortcuts

*   **If a value is increased by x% and then by y%**: Net effect = `(x + y + (xy/100))%`
*   **If a value is increased by x% and then decreased by y%**: Net effect = `(x - y - (xy/100))%`
*   **If A is x% more than B, then B is less than A by**: `(x / (100 + x)) * 100 %`
*   **If A is x% less than B, then B is more than A by**: `(x / (100 - x)) * 100 %`
*   **Memorizing common fraction-to-percentage conversions** can save a lot of time (e.g., 1/2 = 50%, 1/3 = 33.33%, 1/4 = 25%, etc.).
