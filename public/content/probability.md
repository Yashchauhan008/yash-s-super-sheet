# Probability

Probability measures the likelihood of an event occurring. It is expressed as a number between 0 and 1.

## Key Concepts
*   **Event**: An outcome or a set of outcomes of an experiment.
*   **Sample Space**: The set of all possible outcomes.
*   **Mutually Exclusive Events**: Events that cannot happen at the same time.
*   **Independent Events**: The occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of another.
*   **Conditional Probability**: The probability of an event occurring, given that another event has already occurred.

## Formula Shortcuts
*   **Probability of an event P(E)**: `(Number of Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Number of Outcomes)`
*   **P(A or B)** for mutually exclusive events: `P(A) + P(B)`
*   **P(A or B)** for non-exclusive events: `P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)`
*   **P(A and B)** for independent events: `P(A) Ã— P(B)`
*   **Conditional Probability P(A|B)**: `P(A and B) / P(B)`
*   **Complementary Events**: `P(not A) = 1 - P(A)`
