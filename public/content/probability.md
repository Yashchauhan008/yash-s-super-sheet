# Probability

Probability measures the likelihood of an event occurring, expressed as a number between 0 (impossible) and 1 (certain).

## Key Concepts
*   **Sample Space**: The set of all possible outcomes.
*   **Event**: A specific outcome or set of outcomes.
*   **Mutually Exclusive Events**: Events that cannot occur simultaneously.
*   **Independent Events**: The outcome of one event does not affect the other.

## Formula Shortcuts
*   **Probability of an event P(E)**: `(Number of Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Number of Outcomes)`
*   **P(A or B)** for mutually exclusive events: `P(A) + P(B)`
*   **P(A and B)** for independent events: `P(A) × P(B)`
*   **P(not A)**: `1 - P(A)`

## Examples

**1. Dice Roll**
*   **Question**: When two dice are rolled, what is the probability of getting a sum of 8?
*   **Solution**:
    *   Total possible outcomes = 6 × 6 = 36.
    *   Favorable outcomes (sum of 8): (2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), (6,2). There are 5 favorable outcomes.
    *   Probability = `5 / 36`.

**2. Drawing Cards**
*   **Question**: From a standard deck of 52 cards, what is the probability of drawing a King or a Heart?
*   **Solution**:
    *   P(King) = 4/52
    *   P(Heart) = 13/52
    *   There is one card that is both a King and a Heart (the King of Hearts). P(King and Heart) = 1/52.
    *   These events are not mutually exclusive.
    *   P(King or Heart) = P(King) + P(Heart) - P(King and Heart)
    *   `= 4/52 + 13/52 - 1/52 = 16/52 = 4/13`.
