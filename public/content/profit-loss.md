# Profit & Loss

This topic applies percentage concepts to business transactions to determine gain or loss.

## Key Concepts
*   **Cost Price (CP)**: The purchase price.
*   **Selling Price (SP)**: The selling price.
*   **Profit**: `SP - CP` (when SP > CP).
*   **Loss**: `CP - SP` (when CP > SP).
*   **Marked Price (MP)**: The label price.
*   **Discount**: Reduction on MP.

## Formula Shortcuts
*   **Profit %**: `(Profit / CP) * 100`
*   **Loss %**: `(Loss / CP) * 100`
*   **SP**: `CP * (100 + Profit %) / 100`
*   **If two items are sold at the same SP, one at x% gain and another at x% loss**: There is always a loss of `(x/10)^2 %`.

## Examples

**1. Basic Profit Calculation**
*   **Question**: A shopkeeper buys a toy for $120 and sells it for $150. Find his profit percentage.
*   **Solution**:
    *   CP = $120, SP = $150
    *   Profit = SP - CP = 150 - 120 = $30
    *   Profit % = `(Profit / CP) * 100 = (30 / 120) * 100 = 25%`

**2. Same Selling Price**
*   **Question**: A man sells two watches for $99 each. On one, he gains 10%, and on the other, he loses 10%. What is his overall gain or loss?
*   **Solution**:
    *   Here, x = 10.
    *   This is a case of the same selling price with equal gain and loss percentages.
    *   There will be a net loss.
    *   Loss % = `(x/10)^2 % = (10/10)^2 % = 1^2 % = 1%` loss.
