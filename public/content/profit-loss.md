# Profit & Loss

This topic deals with the financial gains and losses in a transaction. It is a direct application of percentages.

## Key Concepts

*   **Cost Price (CP)**: The price at which an item is purchased.
*   **Selling Price (SP)**: The price at which an item is sold.
*   **Profit (Gain)**: `SP - CP` (when SP > CP)
*   **Loss**: `CP - SP` (when CP > SP)
*   **Marked Price (MP)**: The price listed on the item.
*   **Discount**: A reduction on the Marked Price.

## Formula Shortcuts

*   **Profit %**: `(Profit / CP) * 100`
*   **Loss %**: `(Loss / CP) * 100`
*   **SP**: `CP * (100 + Profit %) / 100`
*   **SP**: `CP * (100 - Loss %) / 100`
*   **CP**: `SP * 100 / (100 + Profit %)`
*   **CP**: `SP * 100 / (100 - Loss %)`
*   **Discount %**: `(Discount / MP) * 100`
*   **If two items are sold at the same price, one at a gain of x% and another at a loss of x%**: There is always a loss, and the loss % = `(x/10)^2 %`.
