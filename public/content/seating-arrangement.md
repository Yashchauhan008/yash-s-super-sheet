# Seating Arrangement

These problems require arranging people or objects according to a given set of conditions.

## Key Concepts & Types
*   **Linear Arrangement**: People are arranged in a single line (facing North, South, or a mix).
*   **Circular Arrangement**: People are arranged around a circle (facing the center or away from it).
*   **Rectangular/Square Arrangement**: People are arranged around a rectangular or square table.
*   **Double Row Arrangement**: People are seated in two parallel rows, often facing each other.

## Problem-Solving Techniques
1.  **Visualize and Draw**: Draw the basic structure (a line, a circle, etc.).
2.  **Identify Definite Information**: Start with the most concrete piece of information (e.g., "A is at the far left end").
3.  **Use Relative Information**: Use statements like "B is to the immediate right of A" to place subsequent people.
4.  **Handle Negative Information**: Note down what is not possible (e.g., "C is not a neighbor of A").
5.  **Circular Arrangements**: In a circle, "right" means clockwise and "left" means anti-clockwise (if facing the center). The concept of "opposite" is also important.
