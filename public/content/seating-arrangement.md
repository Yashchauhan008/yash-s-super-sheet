# Seating Arrangement

These problems require arranging people or objects according to a given set of conditions.

## Key Concepts & Types
*   **Linear Arrangement**: In a single line.
*   **Circular Arrangement**: Around a circle (facing center or outwards).
*   **Rectangular/Square Arrangement**: Around a table.

## Problem-Solving Techniques
1.  **Draw the Structure**: Start with a line or circle.
2.  **Use Definite Information First**: Place people whose positions are fixed.
3.  **Connect Relative Information**: Use statements like "B is to the immediate right of A".
4.  **Circular Arrangements**: "Right" means clockwise and "left" means anti-clockwise (if facing the center).

## Examples

**1. Linear Arrangement**
*   **Question**: Five friends P, Q, R, S, and T are sitting in a row facing North. S is between T and Q. Q is to the immediate left of R. P is to the immediate left of T. Who is in the middle?
*   **Solution**:
    1.  `P is to the immediate left of T`: P T
    2.  `S is between T and Q`: P T S Q
    3.  `Q is to the immediate left of R`: P T S Q R
    *   The final arrangement is P, T, S, Q, R.
    *   **S** is in the middle.

**2. Circular Arrangement**
*   **Question**: A, B, C, and D are playing cards. C is to the immediate right of A, and D is to the immediate left of A. Who is to the right of D?
*   **Solution**:
    *   Assume they are sitting in a circle facing the center.
    *   `D is to the left of A` and `C is to the right of A`. This means the order is D, A, C.
    *   The only person left is B, who must be opposite A.
    *   The arrangement is D, A, C, B in a clockwise manner.
    *   To the right of D is A.
