# Syllogism

Syllogisms consist of a few statements and conclusions drawn from them. You must decide if the conclusions are logically valid based on the statements.

## Key Concepts
*   **Statements (Premises)**: The given information.
*   **Conclusions**: Inferences that may or may not follow from the statements.
*   **Quantifiers**:
    *   **Universal Positive**: All (e.g., All A are B).
    *   **Universal Negative**: No (e.g., No A is B).
    *   **Particular Positive**: Some (e.g., Some A are B).
    *   **Particular Negative**: Some not (e.g., Some A are not B).

## Problem-Solving Techniques
1.  **Venn Diagrams**: The most reliable method. Draw circles to represent the categories mentioned in the statements.
2.  **Rules of Inference**:
    *   From "All A are B", you can infer "Some A are B" and "Some B are A".
    *   From "No A is B", you can infer "No B is A" and "Some A are not B".
    *   From "Some A are B", you can infer "Some B are A".
3.  **Possibility vs. Certainty**: A conclusion is only true if it holds in all possible Venn diagrams that can be drawn from the statements. If it's true in one diagram but false in another, it's considered a possibility, not a definite conclusion.
