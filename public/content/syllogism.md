# Syllogism

Syllogisms test deductive reasoning. You must determine if conclusions logically follow from given statements.

## Key Concepts
*   **Statements (Premises)**: The given facts.
*   **Conclusions**: Inferences to be tested.
*   **Quantifiers**: All, No, Some, Some not.

## Problem-Solving Techniques
1.  **Venn Diagrams**: The most reliable method. Draw circles to represent the categories. A conclusion is valid only if it holds true for all possible diagrams.
2.  **Rules of Inference**: Understand the direct implications of each type of statement.
3.  **Possibility vs. Certainty**: A conclusion must be certain, not just possible.

## Examples

**1. Basic Syllogism**
*   **Statements**:
    1.  All cats are animals.
    2.  Some animals are pets.
*   **Conclusions**:
    I. Some cats are pets.
    II. Some pets are animals.
*   **Solution**:
    *   Draw a Venn diagram. The 'Animals' circle must contain the 'Cats' circle. The 'Pets' circle must overlap with the 'Animals' circle.
    *   The overlap between 'Pets' and 'Animals' is certain. So, **Conclusion II follows**.
    *   The 'Pets' circle might or might not overlap with the 'Cats' circle. We cannot be certain. So, **Conclusion I does not follow**.

**2. "No" Statement**
*   **Statements**:
    1.  No pen is a pencil.
    2.  All pencils are erasers.
*   **Conclusions**:
    I. No pen is an eraser.
    II. Some erasers are pencils.
*   **Solution**:
    *   The 'Pen' and 'Pencil' circles are separate. The 'Erasers' circle contains the 'Pencil' circle.
    *   The 'Pen' circle could be separate from 'Erasers' or it could overlap. So, **Conclusion I does not follow**.
    *   Since all pencils are erasers, it's certain that some erasers must be pencils. So, **Conclusion II follows**.
