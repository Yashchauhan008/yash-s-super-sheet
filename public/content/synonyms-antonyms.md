# Synonyms & Antonyms

This section tests your vocabulary by asking for words with similar (synonyms) or opposite (antonyms) meanings.

## Key Concepts
*   **Synonym**: A word that means exactly or nearly the same as another word (e.g., `happy` and `joyful`).
*   **Antonym**: A word that means the opposite of another word (e.g., `hot` and `cold`).
*   **Context**: The meaning of a word can change based on how it's used in a sentence.

## Problem-Solving Techniques
1.  **Build Vocabulary**: The most fundamental approach is to learn new words regularly. Use flashcards, read widely, and maintain a vocabulary notebook.
2.  **Learn Root Words, Prefixes, and Suffixes**: Understanding common roots (like 'bene-' for good) and affixes can help you guess the meaning of unknown words.
3.  **Use Elimination**: Even if you don't know the exact synonym or antonym, you might be able to eliminate options that are clearly unrelated.
4.  **Analyze the Connotation**: Determine if the given word has a positive, negative, or neutral feel. This can help you narrow down the choices.
