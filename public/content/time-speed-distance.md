# Time, Speed, Distance

This topic covers the relationship between speed, distance, and time, with applications in problems involving trains, boats, and streams.

## Key Concepts
*   **Basic Formula**: `Distance = Speed Ã— Time`
*   **Average Speed**: `Total Distance / Total Time`
*   **Relative Speed**: `S1 - S2` (same direction), `S1 + S2` (opposite direction).
*   **Boats and Streams**: Downstream (with current), Upstream (against current).

## Formula Shortcuts
*   **Conversion**: `1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s` and `1 m/s = 18/5 km/hr`.
*   **Average speed for a journey with two equal halves at speeds 'a' and 'b'**: `2ab / (a+b)`
*   **Speed of Boat in still water**: `(Downstream Speed + Upstream Speed) / 2`
*   **Speed of Stream**: `(Downstream Speed - Upstream Speed) / 2`

## Examples

**1. Average Speed**
*   **Question**: A car travels from A to B at 40 km/hr and returns from B to A at 60 km/hr. What is the average speed for the entire journey?
*   **Solution**:
    *   Since the distance is the same both ways, we can use the formula:
    *   Average Speed = `(2 * 40 * 60) / (40 + 60)`
    *   `= 4800 / 100 = 48 km/hr`.

**2. Problems on Trains**
*   **Question**: A 150-meter long train is moving at 72 km/hr. How long will it take to cross a 250-meter long platform?
*   **Solution**:
    *   First, convert speed to m/s: `72 * (5/18) = 20 m/s`.
    *   Total distance to be covered = Length of Train + Length of Platform
    *   `= 150 m + 250 m = 400 m`.
    *   Time = `Distance / Speed = 400 / 20 = 20 seconds`.
