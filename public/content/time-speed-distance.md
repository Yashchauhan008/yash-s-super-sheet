# Time, Speed, Distance

This topic covers the relationship between speed, distance, and time. It includes concepts like relative speed, average speed, and problems on trains, boats, and streams.

## Key Concepts
*   **Basic Formula**: `Distance = Speed Ã— Time`
*   **Average Speed**: `Total Distance / Total Time`
*   **Relative Speed**:
    *   Objects moving in the same direction: `S1 - S2`
    *   Objects moving in opposite directions: `S1 + S2`
*   **Boats and Streams**:
    *   Downstream Speed (with the current): `Speed of Boat + Speed of Stream`
    *   Upstream Speed (against the current): `Speed of Boat - Speed of Stream`

## Formula Shortcuts
*   **Conversion**: `1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s` and `1 m/s = 18/5 km/hr`.
*   **Average speed for a journey with two equal halves at speeds 'a' and 'b'**: `2ab / (a+b)`
*   **Time taken for a train of length L1 to cross a stationary object of length L2**: `Time = (L1 + L2) / Speed`
*   **Speed of Boat in still water**: `(Downstream Speed + Upstream Speed) / 2`
*   **Speed of Stream**: `(Downstream Speed - Upstream Speed) / 2`
