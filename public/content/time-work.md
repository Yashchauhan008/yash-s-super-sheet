# Time & Work

This topic deals with the efficiency of individuals or groups and the time they take to complete a task.

## Key Concepts
*   **Work Rate**: The amount of work done per unit of time. (Work Rate = 1 / Time taken).
*   **Combined Work**: When working together, individual work rates are added.
*   **Man-Days**: `M1 * D1 = M2 * D2` (If work is constant).

## Formula Shortcuts
*   **If A and B can do a work in 'x' and 'y' days respectively, time taken together**: `(xy) / (x+y)` days.
*   **If A, B, and C can do a work in 'x', 'y', and 'z' days, time taken together**: `(xyz) / (xy + yz + zx)` days.
*   **Pipes & Cisterns**: Inlet pipes do positive work, outlet pipes do negative work.

## Examples

**1. Working Together**
*   **Question**: A can do a job in 15 days, and B can do the same job in 10 days. In how many days can they complete the job if they work together?
*   **Solution**:
    *   Using the formula: `(15 * 10) / (15 + 10)`
    *   `= 150 / 25 = 6` days.
    *   **Alternative (LCM Method)**:
        *   Assume total work = LCM(15, 10) = 30 units.
        *   A's rate = 30/15 = 2 units/day.
        *   B's rate = 30/10 = 3 units/day.
        *   Combined rate = 2 + 3 = 5 units/day.
        *   Time taken = Total Work / Combined Rate = 30 / 5 = 6 days.

**2. Work and Wages**
*   **Question**: A, B, and C can do a piece of work in 10, 12, and 15 days respectively. If they work together and earn $450, what is the share of B?
*   **Solution**:
    *   Wages are distributed in the ratio of work done (or efficiency).
    *   Ratio of time = 10 : 12 : 15
    *   Ratio of efficiency (work rate) = 1/10 : 1/12 : 1/15.
    *   To simplify, multiply by LCM(10, 12, 15) = 60.
    *   Efficiency ratio = 6 : 5 : 4.
    *   Sum of ratios = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15.
    *   B's share = `(5 / 15) * 450 = (1/3) * 450 = $150`.
