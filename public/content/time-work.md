# Time & Work

This topic involves problems where the efficiency of individuals or groups is considered to determine the time taken to complete a piece of work.

## Key Concepts

*   **Work Rate**: The amount of work done in a unit of time.
*   **Inverse Relationship**: Time is inversely proportional to efficiency. More efficiency means less time to complete the work.
*   **Combined Work**: When multiple entities work together, their individual work rates are added.

## Formula Shortcuts

*   **If A can do a piece of work in 'n' days, then A's 1 day's work**: `1/n`
*   **If A's 1 day's work is 1/n, then A can finish the work in 'n' days.**
*   **If A and B can do a piece of work in 'x' and 'y' days respectively, time taken together**: `(xy) / (x+y)` days.
*   **If A, B, and C can do a piece of work in 'x', 'y', and 'z' days respectively, time taken together**: `(xyz) / (xy + yz + zx)` days.
*   **Concept of Man-Days**: If M1 persons can do W1 work in D1 days working H1 hours per day and M2 persons can do W2 work in D2 days working H2 hours per day, then: `(M1 * D1 * H1) / W1 = (M2 * D2 * H2) / W2`.
